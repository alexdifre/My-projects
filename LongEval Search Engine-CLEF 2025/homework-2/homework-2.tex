%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  This report describes the search engine developed by the team "Searchill" for the LongEval-Retrieval Task 1 at the CLEF 2025 conference. The main objective of the project was to develop an effective yet efficient search engine. To achieve this goal, our team has extensively experimented with various techniques and approaches. To assess system performance, we used the CLEF corpus and human judgements. 
  Our top-performing system, which combines traditional methods with AI, has encouraging results and might be the basis for further advancements in the field.
