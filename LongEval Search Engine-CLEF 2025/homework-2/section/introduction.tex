\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This research endeavors to establish a robust retrieval system capable of adapting to the inherently dynamic nature of the internet. Our methodology leverages the comprehensive Longeval Websearch collection \cite{longeval2025}, an expansive dataset encompassing online pages, thematic topics, and user interaction patterns. This initiative has significantly advanced our comprehension of information retrieval paradigms within the context of contemporary search engines. Notably, we prioritized refining both query and document processing methodologies to optimize ranking efficacy and ensure the delivery of highly pertinent information to users.

The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 delineates our proposed approach; Section 3 details the experimental configuration; Section 4 presents and discusses our principal findings; finally, Section 5 offers concluding remarks and outlines directions for future research.

\subsection{Related Work}
Guided by the instructional sessions from the SearchEngines course at the University of Padua, we proceeded with the systematic development of the core components—namely, the indexer, analyzer, and searcher—adhering to the architectural framework introduced and thoroughly examined during the class.
